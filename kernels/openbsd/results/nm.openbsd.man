     The symbol table (name list) of each object in _f_i_l_e_(_s_) is displayed.  If
     a library (archive) is given, nnmm displays a list for each object archive
     member.  If _f_i_l_e is not present, nnmm searches for the file _a_._o_u_t and
     displays its symbol table if it exists.

     The options are as follows:

     --aa      Display symbol table entries inserted for use by debuggers.

     --CC      Decode low-level symbol names.  This involves removing extra
             underscores and making C++ function names readable.

     --ee      Output extended information, that is `w' for weak symbols, `f'
             for function-like symbols, and `o' for object-like symbols.

     --gg      Restrict display to external (global) symbols.

     --nn      Present results in numerical order.

     --oo      Display full path or library name of object on every line.

     --pp      Do not sort at all.

     --rr      Reverse order sort.

     --ss      Show archive index.

     --uu      Display undefined symbols only.

     --ww      Warn about non-object archive members.  Normally, nnmm will
             silently ignore all archive members which are not object files.

     Each symbol name is preceded by its value (a blank field if the symbol is
     undefined) and one of the following letters:

           --       debugger symbol table entries (see the --aa option)
           A       absolute
           B       bss segment symbol
           C       common symbol
           D       data segment symbol
           I       indirect reference (alias to other symbol)
           F       file name
           R       read-only data segment symbol
           T       text segment symbol
           U       undefined
           W       weak symbol (only on ELF binaries)

     If the symbol is local (non-external), the type letter is in lower case.
     The output is sorted alphabetically.

     The nnmm utility appears as an optional part of IEEE Std 1003.1-2008
     (``POSIX.1''); this incarnation of nnmm appears largely incompatible with
     that standard.

     An nnmm command appeared in Version 6 AT&T UNIX.
